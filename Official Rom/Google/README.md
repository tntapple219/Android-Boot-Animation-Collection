## üìÅ Structure

| Folder             | Description                                                  |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Pixel/Pixel_3a/`  | Boot animations from Pixel 3a (sorted by Android version)     |
| `Pixel/Pixel_7/`   | Boot animations from Pixel 7 (sorted by Android version)      |
| `Nexus/Android 6.0/` | Boot animation used in Nexus devices running Android 6.0     |

Pixel folders are divided by **device**, then by **Android version** (e.g. `Android 13/`, `Android 14/`).  
Nexus boot animations are grouped **only by Android version**, as most Nexus devices shared the same animation per version.

Each subfolder contains one or more `bootanimation.zip` files.  
If multiple styles exist, they are provided with descriptive filenames like `dark`, `light`, `alt`, etc.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Notes

- Resolution may vary depending on device model and region.
- If the animation looks distorted, you can edit the `desc.txt` file inside the zip to match your screen resolution (e.g. `1080 2340`).
- All boot animations belong to their respective original sources: **Google Inc.**
- **Nexus** animations are generally shared across models.  
  **Pixel** animations are more likely to be **device-specific**, even if the Android version is the same.
