# 🎨 Boot Animations – Custom ROM Collection

Welcome to the **Custom ROM Boot Animations** archive! 🚀

This repo curates unique and creative boot animations from **community-made Android ROMs** like LineageOS, crDroid, Pixel Experience, and more.

## 📁 Structure

Each ROM folder typically includes:
- A `bootanimation.zip` or animation preview
- ROM name and version (if known)
- Origin (e.g. official site, preinstalled, GitHub link)

## 🧩 Sources

Animations here come from:
- Extracted images from custom ROMs
- ROM developer GitHub repos
- Community shares

## 🛠 Installation

Same as always:
1. Rename to `bootanimation.zip`
2. Push to:
   - `/system/media/` or
   - `/data/local/`
3. Set permissions to `644` (`rw-r--r--`)

## ❤️ Credits
All boot animations belong to their respective ROM developers and artists. Full credit goes to their amazing work.

Fly your favorite ROM’s flag with flair! 🏳️‍🌈📱
