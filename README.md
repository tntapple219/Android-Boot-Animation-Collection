## üì¶ How to Replace Your Boot Animation

> ‚ö†Ô∏è *Root access or custom recovery is typically required.*

### üîß Method 1: Manually via File Manager (Root)
1. Download the desired `bootanimation.zip` from this repo.
2. Use a root-enabled file manager (e.g. Root Explorer, MiXplorer).
3. Navigate to:
   - `/system/media/` (for system-level boot animation) **OR**
   - `/data/local/` (for user-level override; no need to modify system files).
4. Replace the existing `bootanimation.zip` with your new one.
5. Set file permissions to `rw-r--r--` (`0644`).
6. Reboot your device and enjoy! üöÄ

üí° **If the animation looks distorted or doesn't fit your screen:**  
Please open `desc.txt` inside the `.zip` and modify the resolution (e.g. `1080 2340`) to match your device.  
This is especially important for phones with unusual aspect ratios.
